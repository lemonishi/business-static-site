            Applying for <b>Permanent Residency (PR)</b> in Singapore is a big
            step. If you’ve been living here on an S Pass or Employment Pass and
            want to make Singapore your long-term home, getting PR status can
            provide significant benefits. However, like many expats who approach
            SG Immigration Consultancy, you might find the{" "}
            <b>PR application in Singapore</b> process a bit daunting. After
            all, one small mistake can delay your application or even lead to
            rejection.

            Having been in the immigration consultancy business for over 20
            years, we've seen it all. From missed documents to misunderstandings
            about eligibility, certain mistakes come up time and time again. So,
            let’s dive into some of the most common mistakes expats make when{" "}
            <b>applying for PR in Singapore</b>—and more importantly, how to
            avoid them.

        <p className="text-red-600 md:text-lg font-bold">
          1. Not Checking Eligibility Before Applying
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            One of the most frequent mistakes we see at{" "}
            <b>SG Immigration Consultancy</b> is expats{" "}
            <b>applying for PR in Singapore</b> without confirming their
            eligibility first. Singapore has strict eligibility criteria, and
            applying when you're not qualified can lead to an automatic
            rejection.

          2. Rushing Through the PR Application Process
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            We get it—everyone wants their PR approved as quickly as possible.
            But rushing through the <b>PR application process in Singapore</b>{" "}
            without paying attention to details can lead to costly delays or
            even rejection. Every document you submit must be accurate and
            up-to-date, from your employment records to your tax filings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Missing or outdated documents are among the top reasons why{" "}
            <b>PR applications in Singapore</b> are delayed or rejected. We’ve
            had clients come to us with rejections simply because they
            overlooked a minor detail, like not providing their latest tax
            statement. Working with a <b>PR application agency</b> like{" "}
            <b>SG Immigration Consultancy</b> can help ensure you don’t miss
            anything critical.

          <p>
            Accuracy is everything when <b>applying for PR</b> in Singapore. Any
            inconsistencies in your information can raise red flags. For
            example, if your declared income on your <b>PR application</b>{" "}
            doesn’t match the figures in your tax returns, it’s likely the
            Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will ask for
            clarifications or reject your application altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <b>SG Immigration Consultancy</b>, we help clients cross-check
            their documents to ensure that everything is accurate and
            consistent, minimizing the risk of rejection during the{" "}

            Applying for PR in Singapore can be complicated, especially if

            straightforward. While it’s possible to succeed solo, working with a
            professional PR application agency like SG Immigration Consultancy
