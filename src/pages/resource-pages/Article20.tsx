            <p className="font-bold">1. Standard Processing Time: 4–6 Months</p>
            <p>
              For most applicants, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA)
              takes four to six months to process PR applications. This timeline
              assumes a well-prepared and error-free application.

              Pro Tip: Submitting complete documentation and aligning your

              standard timeframe.

            Not all PR applications are created equal. Let’s explore the main
            factors that influence processing times.

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p className="font-bold">1. The Completeness of Your Application</p>
            <p>
              Incomplete or inaccurate applications are the most common cause of
              delays. Missing documents, errors, or inconsistencies can trigger
              requests for additional information, extending the timeline
              significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why Work with an Agency: A PR application agency ensures every
              document is complete and error-free, preventing unnecessary
              delays.

              Your profession, income, and contributions to Singapore play a
              significant role in how quickly ICA processes your application.
              High-demand industries like technology, healthcare, and finance
              often see faster approvals.
            </p>

              Pro Tip: Highlight your achievements and community involvement to

              Applications submitted during peak periods or after major policy
              changes may take longer due to increased volume.

            <p>
              A PR application agency can significantly reduce the time and
              effort required to prepare your application. Agencies ensure your
              documents are complete, accurate, and tailored to ICA’s
              expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: A client we worked with received PR approval in just four
              months after submitting a meticulously prepared application
              through our agency.

            <p className="font-bold">1. Track Your Application Status</p>

              This ensures you’re aware of any requests for additional
              documents.

              Even while waiting, continue contributing to Singapore through
              taxes, volunteering, or professional development. This can
              strengthen your case if ICA requests additional information.
