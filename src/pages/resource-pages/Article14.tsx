          1. Skipping the Eligibility Check
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            Not everyone qualifies for PR, and applying without verifying your
            eligibility is a common blunder. Many waste time and effort
            submitting applications only to face rejection due to basic
            ineligibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            How an Agency Helps: A PR application agency conducts a thorough
            assessment of your profile to ensure you meet the ICA’s criteria
            before applying.

        <p className="text-red-600 md:text-lg font-bold">
          2. Submitting Incomplete Documentation
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            Missing documents are one of the top reasons for delayed or rejected
            applications. From tax records to employment letters, every detail
            matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            How an Agency Helps: Agencies provide a comprehensive checklist and
            double-check all documents to ensure nothing is left out.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-red-600 md:text-lg font-bold">
          3. Inconsistent Information
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            Discrepancies between your application and supporting documents can
            raise red flags with ICA. For example, mismatched income details or
            outdated addresses can create unnecessary complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            How an Agency Helps: With meticulous attention to detail, a PR
            application agency ensures your information is consistent and
            error-free.

        <p className="text-red-600 md:text-lg font-bold">
          5. Applying Too Early
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            Many applicants rush to submit their PR applications as soon as they
            hit the minimum eligibility requirements. While enthusiasm is great,
            ICA values stability and long-term contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            How an Agency Helps: A PR application agency advises you on the best
            time to apply, ensuring your profile is as strong as possible.

          6. Weak Personal Narrative

        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            Your cover letter is your chance to make a personal connection with
            ICA, but many applicants overlook its importance. A weak or generic
            letter can make your application less compelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            How an Agency Helps: Agencies craft personalized cover letters that
            highlight your strengths, contributions, and commitment to
            Singapore.

        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6 text-xs md:text-sm">
          <p>
            ICA values applicants who are socially integrated. Many people
            forget to include details about their volunteering efforts or local
            community activities.
