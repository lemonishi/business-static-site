            If you’re considering applying for Permanent Residency (PR) in
            Singapore, one of the first questions to ask is, "Is my job eligible
            for Singapore PR?" While PR eligibility depends on several factors,
            your profession and industry play a significant role in determining
            your chances of approval.

            Knowing what ICA looks for can help you tailor your application to

            <p className="font-bold">1. Job Stability</p>
            <p>
              Consistent employment, preferably with the same company for at
              least two years, demonstrates stability. Job-hopping or frequent
              changes can weaken your profile.

            <p className="font-bold">2. Income Level</p>
            <p>
              Higher income often correlates with greater contributions to
              Singapore’s tax system. ICA views this positively, especially for
              roles that come with upward salary growth.

              Professionals in high-demand industries are often prioritized over
              those in oversaturated sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: A software developer working on AI projects is more
